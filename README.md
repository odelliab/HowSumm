# HowSumm

HowSumm is a large-scale Query-focused multi-document summarization dataset.
It is focused on summarization of various sources to create HowTo guides. It is derived from [wikiHow](https://www.wikihow.com/) articles.

HowSumm is partitioned into HowSumm-Step where target summary is relatively short (avg. 90  words) and HowSumm-Method where target summary is a concatenation of several steps an therefore longer (avg. 500 words). 
HowSumm-Method and HowSumm-Step contain 11,121 and 84348 instances, respectively.
